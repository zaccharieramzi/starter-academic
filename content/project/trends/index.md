During the pandemic and the associated lockdown, we decided with fellow Parietal team members to participate in a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/overview/timeline) in order to strenghten the team's bond.
This challenge was particularly well-suited for the team because it was dealing with data that we are used to; brain data.

It was really thrilling to be able to work on a common topic even though we were all far away.

I particularly liked how this challenge was the opportunity for [David Sabbagh](https://twitter.com/davsabbagh?lang=fr) to apply [his research of manifold regression for M/EEG data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02687).

Other major team members were [Thomas Bazeille](https://twitter.com/tbazeill?lang=fr) and [Jerome Dockes](https://jeromedockes.github.io/), although others have tried to participate.

We ended up finishing with a silver medal in the top 2%, without using deep learning (despite all my efforts).
