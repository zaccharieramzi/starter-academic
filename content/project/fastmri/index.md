The fastMRI dataset was the first of its kind; large-scale enough to allow deep learning and with raw data.
The first associated competition had been held in 2019, and was a major success for pushing the development of deep learning in MRI reconstruction.

After implementing the XPDNet, I decided to take part in the 2020 edition of the competition, and managed to secure the 2nd spot after the radiologist evaluation.

I was able to present my work at the NeurIPS 2020 Medical Imaging Workshop, and my work has been featured in 2 specialized press articles.

I was really happy of this result, given I was alone working on this project, and did chose to make my work open (which is not the case of the winners).

I am also really happy that [the associated code](https://github.com/zaccharieramzi/fastmri-reproducible-benchmark) is being used so much.
In particular, I received a lot of comments/mails from students using it and finding it very helpful for their work.
It is also the 2nd most starred repo for the "fastmri" tag on GitHub after [the official fastMRI repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI) (see [here](https://github.com/topics/fastmri)).
