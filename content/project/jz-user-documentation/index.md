I co-created the user documentation for Jean Zay in an effort to collaboratively improve the documentation rather than relying on the official documentation which might be more difficult to navigate.
Additionally, an [informal forum](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jean-zay-users_jean-zay-doc:gitter.im) was created for users to ask questions and share their knowledge.
This has been a great success because official support staff is now answering most of the questions on this forum.
