title: "Playing with ML tools on a cluster: my experience using Hydra and Weights&Biases on Jean Zay"

event: AI dev talks session 4

location: Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence and Online

summary: Small tutorial talk on the use of Hydra and Weights&Biases on Jean Zay.
abstract: "Experiments management is one of the key aspects to reproducible research. It is often challenging to find the perfect tool that allows to do seemingly contradicting things: organize our experiments better, while still being agile and not cumbersome to use. My experience is limited to using only Weights&Biases for this task, so I cannot compare but only share what I have liked and disliked so far. A particularly likeable aspect is that I found it integrated really well with the configuration manager Hydra. In this talk, I will showcase a relatively simple example. This will illustrate why I have chosen to use this tooling combination on Jean Zay for my upcoming research endeavors."
