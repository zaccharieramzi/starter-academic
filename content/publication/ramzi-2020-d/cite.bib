 abstract = {We present a new neural network, the XPDNet, for MRI reconstruction from periodically under-sampled multi-coil data. We inform the design of this network by taking best practices from MRI reconstruction and computer vision. We show that this network can achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction results, as shown by its ranking of second in the fastMRI 2020 challenge.},
