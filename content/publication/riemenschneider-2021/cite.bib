 abstract = {The next round of the fastMRI reconstruction challenge took place, this time using anatomical brain data. Submissions were ranked by SSIM and resulting ?nalists again by 6 radiologists. We observed the cases with clear SSIM separation achieving the highest radiologists' rankings, in particular the winning reconstructions. Most 4x track reconstructions exhibit desirable image quality, with some exceptions that show anatomy-like hallucinations. Radiologist sentiment decreased for the 8x and Transfer tracks, indicating that these may require further investigation.},
