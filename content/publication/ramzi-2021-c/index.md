abstract: "Deep Learning has become a very promising avenue for magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction. In this work, we explore the potential of unrolled networks for the non-Cartesian acquisition setting. We design the NC-PDNet, the first density-compensated unrolled network and validate the need for its key components via an ablation study. Moreover, we conduct some generaliz-ability experiments to test our network in out-of-distribution settings, for example training on knee data and validating on brain data. The results show that the NC-PDNet out-performs the baseline models visually and quantitatively in the 2D settings. Additionally, in the 3D settings, it out-performs them visually. In particular, in the 2D multi-coil acquisition scenario, the NC-PDNet provides up to a 1.2 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) over baseline networks, while also allowing a gain of at least 1 dB in PSNR in generalization settings. We provide the open-source implementation of our network, and in particular the Non-uniform Fourier Transform in TensorFlow, tested on 2D multi-coil and 3D data. 1"
